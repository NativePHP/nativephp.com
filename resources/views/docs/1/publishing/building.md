# Building Your App

Building your app is the process of compiling your application into a production-ready state. When building, NativePHP
attempts to sign and notarize your application. Once signed, your app is ready to be distributed.

**Migrations only work if you update your `config/nativephp.php` `version`**

The build process compiles your app for one platform at a time. It compiles your application along with the
Electron/Tauri runtime into a single executable.

Once built, you can distribute your app however you prefer, but NativePHP also provides a [publish command](publishing)
that will automatically upload your build artifacts to your chosen [provider](/docs/publishing/updating) - this allows
your app to provide automatic updates.

You should build your application for each platform you intend to support and test it on each platform _before_
publishing to make sure that everything works as expected.

## Running a build

```shell
php artisan native:build
```

This will build for the platform and architecture where you are running the build.

### Cross-compilation

You can also specify a platform to build for by passing the `os` argument, so for example you could build for Windows
whilst on a Mac:

```shell
php artisan native:build win
```

Possible options are: `mac`, `win`, `linux`.

**Cross-compilation is not supported on all platforms.**

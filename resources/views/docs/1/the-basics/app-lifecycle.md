# NativePHP Application Lifecycle

When your NativePHP application starts - whether it's in development or production - it performs a series of steps to get your application up and running.

1. The native shell (Electron or Tauri) is started.
2. NativePHP runs `php artisan migrate` to ensure your database is up-to-date.
3. NativePHP runs `php artisan serve` to start the PHP development server.
4. NativePHP boots your application by running the `boot()` method on your `NativeAppServiceProvider`. 
5. NativePHP also dispatches a `ApplicationBooted` event.

## The NativeAppServiceProvider

When running `php artisan native:install`, NativePHP publishes a `NativeAppServiceProvider` to `app/Providers/NativeAppServiceProvider.php`.

You may use this service provider to boostrap your application. 
For example, you may want to open a window, register global shortcuts, or configure your application menu.

The default `NativeAppServiceProvider` looks like this:

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use Native\Laravel\Facades\Window;
use Native\Laravel\Contracts\ProvidesPhpIni;

class NativeAppServiceProvider implements ProvidesPhpIni
{
    /**
     * Executed once the native application has been booted.
     * Use this method to open windows, register global shortcuts, etc.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        Window::open();
    }

    /**
     * Return an array of php.ini directives to be set.
     */
    public function phpIni(): array
    {
        return [
        ];
    }
}
```

## Events

### `ApplicationBooted`
As mentioned above, the `Native\Laravel\Events\App\ApplicationBooted` event is dispatched when your application has been booted.

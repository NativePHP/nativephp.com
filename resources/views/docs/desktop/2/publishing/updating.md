## The Updater

NativePHP ships with a built-in auto-update tool, which allows your users to update your application without needing to
manually download and install new releases.

This leaves you to focus on building and releasing new versions of your application, without needing to worry about
distributing those updates to your users.

**macOS: Automatic updating is only supported for [signed](/docs/publishing/building#signing-and-notarizing)
applications.**

## How it works

The updater works by checking a remote URL for a new version of your application. If a new version is found, the updater
will download the new version and replace the existing application files with the new ones.

This means your application's builds need to be hosted online. NativePHP will automatically upload your application for
you. After configuring the updater, simply use the [`php artisan native:publish`](/docs/publishing/publishing) command.

The updater supports three providers:

- GitHub Releases (`github`)
- Amazon S3 (`s3`)
- DigitalOcean Spaces (`spaces`)

You can configure all settings for the updater in your `config/nativephp.php` file or via your `.env` file.

**The updater will only run when your app is running in production mode.**

## Configuration

The default updater configuration looks like this:

```php
    'updater' => [
        'enabled' => env('NATIVEPHP_UPDATER_ENABLED', true),

        'default' => env('NATIVEPHP_UPDATER_PROVIDER', 'spaces'),

        'providers' => [
            'github' => [
                'driver' => 'github',
                'repo' => env('GITHUB_REPO'),
                'owner' => env('GITHUB_OWNER'),
                'token' => env('GITHUB_TOKEN'),
                'vPrefixedTagName' => env('GITHUB_V_PREFIXED_TAG_NAME', true),
                'private' => env('GITHUB_PRIVATE', false),
                'channel' => env('GITHUB_CHANNEL', 'latest'),
                'releaseType' => env('GITHUB_RELEASE_TYPE', 'draft'),
            ],

            's3' => [
                'driver' => 's3',
                'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
                'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
                'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
                'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
                'endpoint' => env('AWS_ENDPOINT'),
                'path' => env('NATIVEPHP_UPDATER_PATH', null),
            ],

            'spaces' => [
                'driver' => 'spaces',
                'key' => env('DO_SPACES_KEY_ID'),
                'secret' => env('DO_SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
                'name' => env('DO_SPACES_NAME'),
                'region' => env('DO_SPACES_REGION'),
                'path' => env('NATIVEPHP_UPDATER_PATH', null),
            ],
        ],
    ],
```

## Disabling the updater

If you don't want your application to check for updates, you can disable the updater by setting the
`updater.enabled` option to `false` in your `config/nativephp.php` file or via your `.env` file:

```dotenv
NATIVEPHP_UPDATER_ENABLED=false
```

## Manually checking for updates

You can manually check for updates by calling the `checkForUpdates` method on the `AutoUpdater` facade:

```php
use Native\Laravel\Facades\AutoUpdater;

AutoUpdater::checkForUpdates();
```

**Note:** If an update is available, it will be downloaded automatically. Calling `AutoUpdater::checkForUpdates() twice
will download the update two times.

## Quit and Install

You can quit the application and install the update by calling the `quitAndInstall` method on the `AutoUpdater` facade:

```php
use Native\Laravel\Facades\AutoUpdater;

AutoUpdater::quitAndInstall();
```

This will quit the application and install the update. The application will then relaunch automatically.

**Note:** Calling this method is optional â€” any successfully downloaded update will be applied the next time the
application starts.

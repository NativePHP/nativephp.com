## Roadmap

We're currently focused on reaching the next minor release.

## Current Status

NativePHP for Desktop is **production-ready**. So you should feel completely ready to build and distribute apps
with NativePHP.

But we always need your help! If you spot any bugs or feel that there are any features missing, be sure to share
your ideas and questions through the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/nativephp/discussions" target="_blank">forum</a>, by
<a href="https://github.com/nativephp/laravel/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">raising issues/reporting bugs</a>, and discussing on
[Discord](/discord).

#### Can you sponsor?

If you're building an app that you plan to sell,
[can you sponsor the development of NativePHP](/docs/getting-started/sponsoring)? This will help us to continue
maintaining and supporting NativePHP.

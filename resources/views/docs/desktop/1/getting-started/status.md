## Roadmap
We're currently focused on reaching v1.

We've put together a basic [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NativePHP/projects/2/views/1) to help visualize our
current _estimated_ development timeline.

## Current Status
NativePHP is currently in the `beta` stage.

We need your help with testing and bug-hunting, so we want you to _build_ apps with NativePHP.

As we're at the `beta` stage, NativePHP is almost ready for prime-time. This means we think it's ready for
you to distribute your apps to users. But you should be aware of a couple of issues:

- The PHP source code inside your app can be seen _and modified_. We're actively working on a solution for this in time
    for the `v1` release.
- Documentation around signing apps for Microsoft Windows and macOS are not yet available.

**If you're planning to release an app, it may be useful to get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/X62tWNStZK) so
we can run through any last minute checks to ensure your app is in the best shape.**

The more parts of the whole process we can exercise to find bugs and fix them, the better.

Be sure to share your findings through the [forum](https://github.com/orgs/nativephp/discussions), by
[raising issues](https://github.com/nativephp/laravel/issues/new/choose)/reporting bugs, and on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/X62tWNStZK).

#### Can you sponsor? 

If you're building an app that you plan to sell,
[can you sponsor the development of NativePHP](https://github.com/nativephp/laravel?sponsor=1) to help us get to the
v1.0 release sooner?

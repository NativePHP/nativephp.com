## Support NativePHP

NativePHP is wholly dependent on the dedication of its maintainers and contributors, who volunteer their free time to
ensure its continued development and improvement. As we prioritize our paid client work to sustain ourselves, your
support through donations and sponsorships helps us devote more time to the project.

We realize that not everyone is able to contribute of their time to support with responding to tickets or contributing
features and bugfixes. We are open to contributions of financial support and provide the following ways you can
contribute:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/nativephp/laravel?sponsor=1)
- [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nativephp)

All contributions are welcome, at any amount, as a one-off payment or on a recurring schedule.

All monthly sponsors above $10/month will be bestowed the `Sponsor` role on the NativePHP
[Discord](https://discord.gg/X62tWNStZK), granting access to private channels, early access to new releases, and
discounts on future premium services.

Your contributions help cover the costs of development, infrastructure, and community initiatives. Even a small donation
goes a long way in defraying the expenses of working for free to keep this project alive and thriving.

Together, we can continue to grow NativePHP and ensure it remains a valuable tool for the community. 

## NativePHP for mobile

## Corporate Partners

If your organization is using NativePHP, we strongly encourage you to consider a Corporate Sponsorship. This level of
support will provide your team with the added benefits of increased levels of support, hands-on help directly from the
maintainers of NativePHP and promotion of your brand as a supporter of cutting-edge open source work.

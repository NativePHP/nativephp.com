## Support NativePHP

NativePHP is an organization backed by a team of dedicated employees, maintainers, and contributors who commit their time to
ensure its continued development and improvement. Currently, we operate two major projects: NativePHP for Mobile and 
NativePHP for Desktop. Together, we can continue to grow NativePHP and ensure it remains a valuable tool for the community.

### NativePHP for Mobile

If you're interested in NativePHP for Mobile, you can [purchase a license](/mobile), which is the best way you can
support both projects of the NativePHP organization. These funds are used to cover the costs of development, infrastructure,
and community initiatives for both projects.

### NativePHP for Desktop

NativePHP for Desktop is a free, open source project available under MIT license. We encourage and appreciate any
contributions to the project, whether it's through code, documentation, spreading the word, or a financial sponsorship. 
We provide the following ways of making an easy financial contribution:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/nativephp/laravel?sponsor=1)
- [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nativephp)

All contributions are welcome, at any amount, as a one-off payment or on a recurring schedule. These funds are used to 
support the maintainers of the Desktop project.

All monthly sponsors above $10/month will be bestowed the `Sponsor` role on the NativePHP
[Discord](https://discord.gg/X62tWNStZK), granting access to private channels, early access to new releases, and
discounts on future premium services.

## Corporate Partners

If your organization is using NativePHP, we strongly encourage you to consider a Corporate Sponsorship. This level of
support will provide your team with the added benefits of increased levels of support, hands-on help directly from the
maintainers of NativePHP and promotion of your brand as a supporter of cutting-edge open source work.

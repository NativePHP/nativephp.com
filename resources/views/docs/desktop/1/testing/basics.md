# Understanding fake test doubles
When working with a NativePHP application, you may encounter an elevated level of difficulty when writing tests for your code.
This is because NativePHP relies on an Electron/Tauri application to be open at all times, listening to HTTP requests. Obviously,
emulating this in a test environment can be cumbersome. You will often hit an HTTP error, and this is normal. This is where
NativePHP's fake test doubles come in.

```php
use Native\Laravel\Facades\Window;

#[\PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Test]
public function example(): void
{
    Window::fake();

    $this->get('/whatever-action');

    Window::assertOpened('window-name');
}
```

## Where have I seen this before?

If you've ever written tests for a Laravel application, you may have seen the `*::fake()` method available on
all sorts of facades. Under the hood, these methods are swapping the real implementation and behavior – in NativePHP's case,
an HTTP call that forces us to keep the server up and running, in turn degrading the ability to write expressive tests – with a fake one 
that follows the same API. This means you do not have to change any of your code to write great tests.

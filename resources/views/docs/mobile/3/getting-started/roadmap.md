title: Roadmap
order: 400

NativePHP for Mobile is stable and already deployed in production apps released on the app stores. But we're not done
yet! Here's what we're focusing on next:

## Background tasks

We will be adding the ability to run code in the background, even when your app isn't in the foreground. Perfect for
syncing data, processing uploads, or handling push notifications.

## Native UI through EDGE

We will be expanding EDGE's (Element Definition and Generation Engine) capabilities, letting you define more truly
native UI components from your PHP code. Build navigation bars, tab bars, and other native elements that feel right at
home on each platform.

## Performance

We will be improving NativePHP's performance, making apps faster and more efficient. Expect improvements to startup
time, memory usage, and overall responsiveness.

#### Something missing?

With NativePHP's [plugin system](/plugins), the community can build interfaces to any native functionality. If there's
something you need that isn't available yet, you can build it yourself or find a plugin that does what you need.

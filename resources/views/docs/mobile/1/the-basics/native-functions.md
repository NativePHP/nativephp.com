title: Native Functions
order: 100
---

Nearly any basic Laravel app will work as a mobile app with NativePHP for Mobile. However, what makes NativePHP
unique is that it allows you to call native functions from your PHP code.

These functions are called from your PHP code using one of an ever-growing list of facades.

All native functionality is namespaced into its own Facade, they are:

- `Native\Mobile\Facades\Biometrics`
- `Native\Mobile\Facades\Camera`
- `Native\Mobile\Facades\Dialog`
- `Native\Mobile\Facades\Geolocation`
- `Native\Mobile\Facades\Haptics`
- `Native\Mobile\Facades\PushNotifications`
- `Native\Mobile\Facades\SecureStorage`
- `Native\Mobile\Facades\System`

Every mobile app built with NativePHP centers around a single native web view. The web view allows you to use whichever
web technologies you are most comfortable with to build your app's user interface (UI).

You're not limited to any one tool or framework — you can use Livewire, Vue, React, Svelte, HTMX... even jQuery!
Whatever you're most comfortable with for building a web UI, you can use to build a mobile app with NativePHP.

The web view is rendered to fill the entire view of your application and is intended to remain visible to your users at
all times — except when another full-screen action takes place, such as accessing the camera or an in-app browser.

## The Viewport

Just like a normal browser, the web view has the concept of a **viewport** which represents the viewable area of the
page. The viewport can be controlled with the `viewport` meta tag, just as you would in a traditional web application:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### Disable Zoom
When building mobile apps, you may want to have a little more control over the experience. For example, you may
want to disable user-controlled zoom, allowing your app to behave similarly to a traditional native app.

To achieve this, you can set `user-scalable=no`:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
```

## Edge-to-Edge

To give you the most flexibility in how you design your app's UI, the web view occupies the entire screen, allowing you
to render anything anywhere on the display whilst your app is in the foreground using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

But you should bear in mind that not all parts of the display are visible to the user. Many devices have camera
notches, rounded corners and curved displays. These areas may still be considered part of the `viewport`, but they may
be invisible and/or non-interactive.

To account for this in your UI, you should set the `viewport-fit=cover` option in your `viewport` meta tag and use the
safe area insets.

### Safe Areas

Safe areas are the sections of the display which are not obscured by either a physical interruption (a rounded corner
or camera), or some persistent UI, such as the Home Indicator (a.k.a. the bottom bar) or notch.

Safe areas are calculated for your app by the device at runtime and adjust according to its orientation, allowing your
UI to be responsive to the various device configurations with a simple and predictable set of CSS rules.

The fundamental building blocks are a set of four values known as `insets`. These are injected into your pages as the
following CSS variables:

- `--inset-top`
- `--inset-bottom`
- `--inset-left`
- `--inset-right`

You can apply these insets in whichever way you need to build a usable interface.

There is also a handy `nativephp-safe-area` CSS class that can be applied to most elements to ensure they sit within
the safe areas of the display.

Say you want a `fixed`-position header bar like this:

![](/img/docs/viewport-fit-cover.png)

If you're using Tailwind, you might try something like this:

```html
<div class="fixed top-0 left-0 w-full bg-red-500">
    ...
</div>
```

If you tried to do this without `viewport-fit=cover` and use of the safe areas, here's what you'd end up with in
portrait view:

![](/img/docs/viewport-default.png)

And it may be even worse in landscape view:

![](/img/docs/viewport-default-landscape.png)

But by adding a few simple adjustments to our page, we can make it beautiful again (Well, maybe we should lose the
red...):

```html
<body class="nativephp-safe-area">
<div class="fixed top-0 left-0 w-full bg-red-500 pl-[var(--inset-left)] pr-[var(--inset-right)]">
    ...
</div>
```

![](/img/docs/viewport-fit-cover-landscape.png)

### Status Bar Style

On Android, the icons in the Status Bar do not change color automatically based on the background color in your app.
By default, they change based on whether the device is in Light/Dark Mode.

If you have a consistent background color in both light and dark mode, you may use the `nativephp.status_bar_style`
config key to set the appropriate status bar style for your app to give users the best experience.

The possible options are:

- `auto` - the default, which changes based on the device's Dark Mode setting
- `light` - ideal if your app's background is dark-colored
- `dark` - better if your app's background is light-colored

<aside class="relative z-0 mt-5 overflow-hidden rounded-2xl bg-pink-50 px-5 ring-1 ring-black/5 dark:bg-pink-600/10">

#### Missing Config Keys?

If your `config/nativephp.php` file is missing newer config keys, you can simply add them in! Reference them from the
default version of this config file in `vendor/nativephp/mobile/config/nativephp.php`.

Alternatively, you can force-publish the config file by running:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nativephp-mobile-config --force
```

But note that this will overwrite any changes you've made to your copy of this config file.

</aside>

With just a few small changes, we've been able to define a layout that will work well on a multitude of devices
without having to add complex calculations or lots of device-specific CSS rules to our code.

# Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you build better mobile applications with NativePHP. This section covers important topics that apply across different APIs and features.

## Mobile-Specific Concepts

### [CI/CD](/docs/mobile/1/concepts/ci-cd)
**Continuous Integration & Deployment** - Automate your mobile app build and release process with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other platforms. Learn how to set up automated testing, building, and app store deployment.

### [Deep Links](/docs/mobile/1/concepts/deep-links) 
**App Integration** - Connect your app with the mobile ecosystem using deep links, universal links (iOS), app links (Android), and NFC. Enable users to open your app from URLs, other apps, and NFC tags.

### [Push Notifications](/docs/mobile/1/concepts/push-notifications)
**Real-time Engagement** - Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications to your users. Learn about token management, server-side integration, and notification best practices.

### [Splash Screen/Icons](/docs/mobile/1/concepts/splash-screen-icons)
**App Branding** - Create professional app icons and splash screens. Understand platform requirements, asset optimization, and how to provide a great first impression.

### [Versioning](/docs/mobile/1/concepts/versioning)
**Release Management** - Manage app versions across development, staging, and production environments. Learn about semantic versioning, app store requirements, and automated version management.

## Development Workflow

These concepts help you establish efficient development practices:

- **Automated Building** - Set up CI/CD pipelines for consistent builds
- **Asset Management** - Optimize icons, images, and compiled assets
- **Version Control** - Track releases and manage updates
- **User Engagement** - Keep users connected with push notifications
- **App Discovery** - Make your app accessible through links and NFC

## Cross-Platform Considerations

NativePHP abstracts many platform differences, but understanding these concepts helps you:

- Design for both iOS and Android users
- Handle platform-specific requirements
- Optimize for different screen sizes and capabilities
- Meet app store guidelines and requirements

Each concept includes practical examples, best practices, and real-world implementation guidance to help you build professional mobile applications.

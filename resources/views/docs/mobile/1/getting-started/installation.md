```

> **Note** You cannot build iOS apps on Windows or Linux

You don't _need_ a physical iOS/Android device to compile your application and test it for your app, as NativePHP for mobile supports
the iOS Simulator and Android emulators. However, we highly recommend that you test your application on a real device before submitting to the
App/Google Play Store.

## Laravel

NativePHP for mobile is built to work with Laravel. You can install it into an existing Laravel application, or
[start a new one](https://laravel.com/docs/installation). The most painless way to get PHP and Node up and running on your system is with
[Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com). It's fast and free!

## Private package

To make NativePHP for mobile a reality has taken a lot of work and will continue to require even more. For this reason,
it's not open source, and you are not free to distribute or modify its source code.

Before you begin, you will need to purchase a license.
Licenses can be obtained via [Anystack](https://checkout.anystack.sh/nativephp-ios).

Once you have your license, you will need to add the following to your `composer.json`:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://nativephp.composer.sh"
    }
],
```

## Install NativePHP for mobile

```shell
composer require nativephp/mobile
```

If this is the first time you're installing the package, you will be prompted to authenticate. Your username is the email address you registered with Anystack. Your password is your license key.

This package contains all the libraries, classes, commands, and interfaces that your application will need to work with
iOS and Android.

Before running the `install` command it is important to set the following variables in your `.env`:

```shell
NATIVEPHP_APP_ID=com.nativephp.yourapp
NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION="DEBUG"
NATIVEPHP_APP_VERSION_CODE="1"
```

## Run the NativePHP installer

```shell
php artisan native:install
```

The NativePHP installer works similarly to NativePHP for desktop, taking care of setting up and configuring your Laravel
application to work with iOS and/or Android.

## Start your app

**Heads up!** Before starting your app in a native context, try running it in the browser. You may bump into exceptions
which need addressing before you can run your app natively, and may be trickier to spot when doing so.

Once you're ready:

```shell
php artisan native:run
```

This will start compiling your application and boot it in whichever device you select.

### Running on a real device

#### For iOS
If you want to run your app on a real mobile device, you need to make sure the device is in
[Developer Mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) and that it's been added to your Apple Developer account as [a registered device](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/list).

For iOS: You will need to get the device's UDID. You can find this by connecting the device to your Mac and opening it in the
Finder. Click on model name at the top until the UDID appears, then right-click on it to copy it.

Then you can simply run, replacing `{UDID}` with your device's UDID:

```shell
php artisan native:run {UDID}
```

Alternatively, you may open the `ios/NativePHP.xcodeproj` file in Xcode and run builds using Xcode's UI.

#### For Android
On Android you need [enable developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) and have USB debugging (ADB) enabled.

And that's it! You should now see your Laravel application running as a native app! ðŸŽ‰

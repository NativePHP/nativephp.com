If you've already got your [environment set up](environment-setup) to build mobile apps using Xcode and/or Android Studio, then you can
get building your first mobile app with NativePHP in minutes:

```bash
# Install NativePHP for Mobile into a new Laravel app
composer require nativephp/mobile

# Ready your app to go native
php artisan native:install

# Run your app on a mobile device
php artisan native:run
```

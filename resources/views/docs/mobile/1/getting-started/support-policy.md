title: Support Policy
order: 600

NativePHP for Mobile is still very new. We aim to make it workable with as many versions of iOS and Android as is
reasonable. Considering that we have a very small team and a lot of work, our current stance on version support is this:

**We aim (but do not guarantee) to support all the current and upcoming major, currently vendor-supported versions of
the platforms, with a focus on the current major release as a priority.**

In practical terms, as of September 2025, this means we intend for NativePHP to be compatible — in part or in whole —
with:

- iOS 18
- Android 13, 14, 15, 16

We do not guarantee support of all features across these versions, and whilst NativePHP may work in part on even older
versions than the currently-supported ones, we do not provide support for these under this standard policy.

If you require explicit backwards compatibility with older or unsupported versions, we will be happy to have you join
our [partner](/partners) program, where a custom support policy can be arranged.

title: Roadmap
order: 400
---

NativePHP for Mobile is stable and already deployed in production apps released on the app stores. But it's still early
days. We haven't yet built interfaces to all of the available mobile APIs.

We're working on adding more and more features, including (in no particular order):
 - Bluetooth
 - SMS (Android only)
 - File picker
 - Document scanner
 - Background tasks
 - Geofencing
 - Calendar access
 - Local notifications, scheduled notifications
 - Clipboard API
 - Contacts access
 - App badges
 - OTA Updates
 - App review prompt
 - Proximity sensor
 - Gyroscope
 - Accelerometer
 - Screen brightness
 - More Haptic feedback
 - Ads
 - In-app purchases and wallet payments

#### Something missing?

The mobile platforms are very mature and we're working hard to catch up with all their features.
